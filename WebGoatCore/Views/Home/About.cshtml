        Release - 1 - Injection Flaws
    </h2>
    <div>
        In the BlogCreate.aspx page, The user is able to create a blog entry.&nbsp; Both
        the title and the contents input boxes allow the entry of SQL.&nbsp; The user could
        launch a SQL injection attack.&nbsp; We should harden the site by either parameterizing
        the query or by using the BlogRepository that is in the Infrastructure project.
        This will use Entity Framework which is pre-parameterized.
